When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we want others to see our work, and to possibly let them make suggestions/changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that we can work locally to make sure that work is where we want it to be before
	we release it publicly.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: copying someone else's repository, with full credit being attributed to others.
	Clone:  copying someone else's rpository, entirely to one's own local machine.
	Branch:  An offshoot that will allow experimentation, and hence freedom to not totally mess up code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
