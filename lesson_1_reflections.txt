How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was a lot easier than scrolling through lots of info.  
	And easier on the eyes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I would be less scared of making an error.  I can easily go back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I get to choose the timing.
	Cons: I may forget, and up with too many changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To help things move smoothly together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To see what changes have been made between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I do break something, all I have to do is go to a previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
